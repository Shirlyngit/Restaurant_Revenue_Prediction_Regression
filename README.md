# 💸RESTAURANT-REVENUE-PREDICTION-SYSTEM

OBJECTIVE: Build a Machine Learning Revenue prediction to predict restaurant revenue based on 17 selected features, influencing the amount of revenue generated at a particular season for restaurants in a particular demographic area.

Some of these features include:

- 📍 Location of restaurant: eg., Rural, Downtown
- 🇲🇽  Cuisine: type of cuisine offered (eg., Japanese, Mexican, Italian)

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Social Media Followers
- 🧑‍🍳  Chef Experience Years: Number of years of experience of the head chef
- 🅿️ Parking Availability
  including others.

⚒️Tools, Frameworks and Technologies
- Python; pandas, numpy
- Machine Learning libraries: Scikit-learn
- Visualization: seaborn, matplotlib
- Statistics inferences: scipy library
